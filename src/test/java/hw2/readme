#devicename=LGE Nexus 5
#udid=044cd04b09d351ab
#driver=http://EPM-TSTF:091e0b26-be1d-4848-8364-5bb2b1c40d0a@epm-mstfmsq-ci.minsk.epam.com:8080/wd/hub

1. Rewrite (complete) Driver using “singleton” pattern. Are there any advantages?
2. Suggest improvements for .properties reading. What are the purposes?
- separation of web and native properties to let driver to know what properties should it to load depending on test environment
- separation of web and native TestNg configuration files
- adding  <suiteXmlFile> and <propertyFile> to the pom.xml to run specific suite on the CI environment

3. Add checks of other fields and their titles (Contact Name, Contact phone) in “native” test
- checks methods added in PageObjects class containing Android elements of the Native app

4. Optional: Add keyboard presence check in “native” test.
- added method typeName() to PageObjects class to fill the "Contact Name" field;

5. Which checks would you place in the “web” test?
- check if page header logo is visible
- check if page contains sections
- check if HTTP request to resource was fulfilled using responce status code
